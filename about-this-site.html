	<h2 class="Head">About This Site</h2>
<p class="stripeA"> 

When we learn about astronomy and the outside universe, it can seem far away and unimaginably big. So, giving people who are new to astronomy a way to feel connected to the objects is very important. Without it, it could feel like you're drifting through a vacuum without any idea of what is going on. One of the best ways to feel connected to a subject is to be able to mess around and think about it yourself. That's why the interactive on this site lets you highlight different wavelengths of light to make your own composite images of spiral galaxies.

This website offers an introduction to the different types of light, how they move through space, and what they can tell us about space objects. It also highlights how scientists think about spiral galaxies. To explore more on your own, check out the sources below.

<h2 class="b"> Where the Interactive Images Come From </h2>
<p class="stripeB">

	<img class="diagram" src="images/M83 galaxy .jpg">

I needed to limit options for the interactive to space objects for which NASA would have images recorded in different types of light. All of the galaxies in the interactive are in the Messier catalog, which is a list of 108 deep-sky objects that French astronomer Charles Messier and others found in the 1700s. This is why the names for the galaxies start with an "M". The Messier catalog does not have the same amount of objects as the later New General Catalogue, which has more than 5000, but it's an excellent place to start because the objects listed have high magnitude and have been studied for a long time. I looked through the Messier catalog and identified all the spiral galaxies, which were 20-30. Then I looked for data through a NASA website. The seven galaxies that had images in at least three kinds of light became the objects in the Image Interactive.

 <h2>The Process</h2>
<p class="stripeA">
I made this website for a big,  end-of-year school project. My first plan was to do a research paper with several paintings of a space object in different kinds of light. But then I looked at all of these different objects and wanted to build a program that would allow users to overlap the several separate images. I also wanted to control what light was in the picture, a feature I hadn't yet found on another site From there, I thought about what people needed to know to understand what is happening in the interactive and have it all in one space. I broke my research topic down into several web page ideas.   I wrote the code for my interactive program using JavaScript. After that, I wrote the text and found images to illustrate it. I built the website using HTML and CSS.
