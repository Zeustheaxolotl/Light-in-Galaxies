	<h2 class="Head">Electromagnetic Spectrum</h2>
<p class="stripeA"> 
	<img class="diagram" src="images/Diagram of light.jpeg">
Light is a broad spectrum of electromagnetic pulses whose wavelengths can span from tinier than a hydrogen nucleus to longer than 60 miles. So, it makes sense that humans interact with different electromagnetic waves differently. We perceive visible light with our eyes while gamma rays are invisible but can hurt our skin. Still, it is important to recognize that our classifications are somewhat arbitrary. Don't expect a magical difference between red and high energy infrared, just as you shouldn't expect a massive difference between high energy X-rays and low energy gamma rays. The electromagnetic spectrum is amazingly diverse and contributes to much of our perception of our world. 
</p>
<h2 class="b"> Radio </h2>
<p class="stripeB">
<img src="images/Radio Dish.jpeg">

Radio light has the lowest energy on the electromagnetic spectrum and is vital for communication. Because of the radios we use in cars and homes, many people think about radio as a sound wave. This confusion is because radios translate sound waves into radio waves, then broadcast and picked up on other radios and translated into sound waves. Because radio waves have the longest wavelength, they can move long distances. A single wave is up to 60 miles and can quickly move around large buildings, mountains, and other obstacles. So, it is used in phones or when satellites want to communicate down to Earth. SETI sends out radio waves in the hopes of finding alien communication, and extraterrestrial life may reach out to us in the same way. A SETI radio dish collects radio waves from space, hoping to find a pattern. Black holes, lightning, and galaxies also produce radio waves.

 <h2>Microwave</h2>
<p class="stripeA">
	<img src="images/Hurricane in Microwave.png">
Microwaves have a shorter wavelength than radio waves but have wavelengths of one millimeter to one meter. They are used in your kitchen appliance because they energize water molecules to produce heat and heat your food. Because they interact with water, microwaves also are good for tracking weather and sea ice, making them crucial tools for studying climate change and tracking clouds and extreme weather conditions like hurricanes. The different colors in this image of Hurricane Francis in 2004 represent the frequencies or quantity of microwaves being monitored. Extreme amounts of microwaves are bad for humans and can cause cataracts or issues with hearing. Some of the longer wavelength microwaves are used in Bluetooth because they need less space to travel and give more precise data than radio waves. 

</p>
<h2 class="b">Infrared</h2>
<p class="stripeB">
		<img src="images/IR img.jpeg">

Infrared light is one of the better-known forms of light. It's essential to separate it into two categories, each of which behaves differently. Near-infrared refers to light closer to the visible spectrum, which is used in transporting short data distances and is not hot at all. TV remotes use near-infrared light to communicate with the TV. It's challenging to study objects outside our atmosphere near-infrared because water vapor in the atmosphere absorbs almost all of it. However, this means that near-infrared can also be used to study weather patterns, just like microwaves. Near-infrared is also good for looking at plant health because it can see how much water vapor the plants have. The brilliant red along the banks of the Mississippi River in this photo shows long stretches of healthy, happy plants. To look at near-infrared light beyond our atmosphere, scientists send telescopes into space to orbit around the Earth. In contrast, far-infrared refers to light closer to microwaves, generating heat, so thermal imaging shows its rays. Anything with heat gives off far-infrared light, including the sun, your oven, and the human body. Some animals, like snakes, see in the far-infrared spectrum to make it easier to track and catch their prey. Medicine can also use far-infrared light.

<h2>Visible</h2>
<p class="stripeA">
	<img src="images/M33.jpeg">

Visible light is the wavelengths that humans see, and it has strongly shaped our understanding of the universe. Sight is the sense that humans rely on the most, so our ability to see shapes what we are curious about. Would we even focus on the sky if our primary sense was hearing, touch, or taste? Visible light emanates from stars, galaxy centers, black holes, and much more. Our understanding of visible light separates into seven colors; different materials reflect different wavelengths of light, which helps us interpret the colors. Colors and light help us examine our surrounding world, nearby creatures, and even the spiral arms of galaxies. The visible spectrum is the range of light that reaches Earth's surface the most, which is why most animals also rely on these wavelengths. 

</p>
<h2 class="b">Ultraviolet</h2>
<p class="stripeB">
	<img src="images/UV flowers.jpeg">

Ultraviolet is light with a shorter wavelength than visible light. Whether exposure to ultraviolet helps or hurts you depends on how many waves you get. This light gives you vitamin D, helps with skin disorders and can break down viruses. But too many ultraviolet waves will give you a sunburn. Luckily for most of us, ultraviolet rays are mostly blocked by the ozone layer in our atmosphere. This kind of energy can speed up or encourage chemical reactions, especially with blood and saliva. And it is used on federal documents to make counterfeiting difficult. But humans are not the only ones who use this kind of light to their advantage. Some insects, including bees, can see ultraviolet light reflected by flowers and use it as a beacon. This is good for everyone. After all, it highlights where bees can get nectar and is suitable for plants because it leads bees to pollinate flowers. 

</p>
<h2>X-ray</h2>
<p class="stripeA">
	<img src="images/Bones in Xray.jpeg">

Compared to other forms of light, X-rays are rare on Earth. Objects that typically produce X-rays have temperatures of millions of degrees, but none of the X-rays produced in space reach through the atmosphere to the surface of our planet. Most likely, the only time that you will ever be in physical contact with X-rays is the doctor's office. Because of X-rays' unique ability to bypass the squishy and liquid parts of your body--blood, muscles, and skin--they provide a simple and non-intrusive way to look inside people. Have you ever had a broken bone and the doctors took X-rays to figure out how to help you heal? Because X-rays are blocked by bone, they can show how many places the bone broke and get more information about your wound. X-ray machines are lifesavers. Beginning during World War II, doctors used them to look at soldiers' wounds and locate bullets and other debris inside them. X-rays can be harmful to humans with prolonged exposure.  
</p>
<h2 class="b">Gamma</h2>
<p class="stripeB">
	<img src="images/lightning.jpeg">

Gamma rays, which are the most energetic form of light, are so powerful that they can knock electrons out of their orbits. In space, neutron stars, pulsars, or black holes are some of the few things that produce gamma rays, but gamma rays from space do not reach Earth's surface. On Earth, gamma rays are produced only by lightning and nuclear energy, which make energetic fluctuations in the electromagnetic fields. It's good that gamma rays aren't produced often on Earth because they can cause cellular damage and even damage to your DNA. Gamma rays aren't all bad for humans; gamma radiation can be used in cancer treatment to hurt diseased cells. Because they can penetrate many substances, gamma rays also can pasteurize or sterilize substances.
