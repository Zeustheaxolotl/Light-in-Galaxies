	<h2 class="Head">What are galaxies?</h2>
<p class="stripeA"> 
	<img src="images/Milky way.jpeg">

Galaxies are spinning clumps of stars, gas, and other matter held together by gravity. In all but the smallest galaxies, these elements orbit around a black hole, an area so dense that nothing--not even light--can escape its pull of gravity. Right now, you and I sit on a planet inside the Milky Way galaxy, which spans billions of light-years across. Some galaxies--like the nearby Larger Magellanic Cloud--are small, only a few light-years across. The Larger Magellanic Cloud is orbiting our galaxy and will eventually get sucked into the Milky Way. Galaxies also cluster together, bound by each other's gravity and a mysterious phenomenon called dark matter, which scientists know little about. The difference between a galaxy cluster and satellite galaxies is scale. Often a large galaxy will have up to thirty small satellite galaxies; however, clusters have massive galaxies and lots of them, from hundreds to thousands.

<h2 class="b"> What are galaxies' shapes?</h2>

Galaxies tend to come in three different shapes: spiral, elliptical, and irregular. Three-quarters of all known galaxies fall under the spiral shape, which means that they appear to have long tendrils of matter that curve out from the galaxy center. Next, these galaxies are flat because galaxies are in constant motion, turning quickly around their centers of gravity--and when something spins, it flattens out. The direction in which galaxies spin determines how they "face" because of how they flatten out. Spiral galaxies sometimes have bars at their centers, which is when the glow from their center is elliptical or elongated. This phenomenon is temporary and may be an essential step in the evolution of galaxies.

<p class="stripeB">
Within spiral galaxies, there are several different shapes. Whether the galaxy has six arms or two, it still is a spiral galaxy. Some galaxies have arms that don't end but instead seem to merge. For more information about why galaxies have spiral arms, go to either the wave density theory or SSPSF pages.

	<h2>How did galaxies form?</h2>
<p class="stripeA"> 
	<img src="images/galaxies cluster.jpeg">

While scientists are not entirely sure how galaxies formed, they have a few ideas. After the Big Bang, the universe was thick with subatomic particles and energy. It's possible that stars formed, and then gravitational forces pulled them into star clusters and then galaxies, and then galaxy clusters.  Or it's possible that gravity made groups of particles stick together, and these groupings slowly evolved into the galaxies we see today. This picture shows a closeup of a galaxy cluster. We are not entirely sure because galaxies are not forming as often now as the universe expands, and the matter from the Big Bang has already been divided into many clumps. 
<h2 class="b">What are galactic collisions? </h2>
<p class="stripeB"> 
	<img class="s" src="images/Mice Hubble.jpeg">
How galaxies collide depends on their size. When a small galaxy is pulled into a larger galaxy, it gets stretched apart and eventually gobbled by the more massive black hole at the center of the giant galaxy. When two black holes meet, whichever one is larger will absorb the other. The more powerful galaxy is usually not much disturbed and continues with business as usual. 
	</p>
	<p class="stripeB"> 
If the galaxies are the same size, then the collision is much more disruptive. First, the galaxies will elongate their arms or matter as though the center drags them. The centers will move quickly towards each other and most likely miss. They will then slow down and go in reverse until finally, the galaxy's centers meet. Merging fundamentally changes the shape of the galaxies, which usually will become elliptical or irregular. Scientists predict that the Milky Way and our neighbor Andromeda will eventually have one such crash, forming a giant elliptical galaxy. Scientists call this far-in-the-future galaxy Milkomeda. Scientists believe Earth will not be genuinely affected by this collision billions of years from now because our planet is not close to our galaxy's center. It is likely that the only tangible change Earth will experience is where it sits in our galaxy.
