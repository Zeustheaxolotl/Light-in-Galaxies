	<h2 class="Head">What is light?</h2>
<p class="stripeA"> 

Our senses, in particular sight, shape our interests in the world, and what we think is essential to understand. So often, we rely on light to give us information about what we study. Because light has many exciting qualities, it ties together what we research and what we value. So we must learn how light functions to understand ourselves better. Light impacts how we perceive and understand our world, but to really perceive and understand our world, we must understand how light operates. 
</p>
<h2 class="b"> What is the electromagnetic spectrum? </h2>
<p class="stripeB">

	<img class="diagram" src="images/Light Diagram 2.jpeg">

Light's beginnings are not humble and set a standard for all that light can accomplish. Light comes from vibrations between electrically charged objects. Electromagnetism is electric fields that create a magnetic force and vice versa, so magnetics and electricity are two sides of the same coin. One of the differences between light and sound is that light can move through a vacuum, and sound cannot. This is because sound as a vibration of matter needs matter to continue. In contrast, light does not need to move through matter and so can continue over long stretches of empty space. Also, not many things nearby us produce light. Natural phenomena that generate light we see on Earth include our sun and other stars and lightning. Many items--such as the moon, any body of water, and trees--just reflect light into our eyes, instead of producing it.

 <h2>How is light a particle and a wave?</h2>
<p class="stripeA">
	<img src="images/Photon diagram.jpeg">
Light is fascinating in that it is both energy and matter. This is the only way that scientists can explain all of light's properties and abilities. One of these qualities is that light's speed is constant through a vacuum. This is because light is a particle with no mass. While this may seem like an oxymoron, it is possible. A photon is a packet of the light's energy that moves in its wave shape. Light is also a wave with different wavelengths ranging from smaller than a nucleus and to longer than 60 miles. For more information about different wavelengths of light, look at Types of Light. 

</p>
<h2 class="b">What does light tell us about the past? </h2>
<p class="stripeB"> 
	<img class="s" src="images/galaxy cluster.jpeg">
When we look into the night sky, as shown in this photo, the pinpricks and smudges of light represent stars, planets and even whole galaxies. Without significant study we can't decipher the proximity and scale of a specific bright spot. With close observation, however, it is possible to determine how big, how far away--how long the light has been traveling to reach us. 
	</p>
	<p class="stripeB"> 
Light is our opportunity to peer into the past. Because light travels at a certain speed, it takes time for information from far away to reach us. And because nothing can travel faster than the speed of light, the farther you look in the distance, the farther you look into the past. For example, think of a star that is 20 light-years away. And let's say that this star explodes brilliantly. It will take 20 years for the light waves from the explosion to reach us on Earth. So while in our perception the star is still whole and burning brightly, it actually has already exploded. We could consider light a hindrance to understanding what's happening right now. Or we could celebrate this way to peer into our universe's past. When our technology is strong enough, we can look backward in time to billions of years ago. We can even see some of the galaxies that formed after the Big Bang.

	<h2>How does color work? </h2>
<p class="stripeA"> 
	<img class="s" src="images/atom diagram.png">
If objects don't produce their own light, then how do they appear as a particular color? To answer this, we need to look deep into objects on an atomic level. Atoms are made of neutrons, protons, and electrons. The neutrons and protons center the nucleus, while the electrons "move" around in orbits. There are more orbits than just one for electrons, and the amount of energy they have decides which orbit they are in. However, not all bits of energy will transport electrons to the next level.
	</p>
	<p class="stripeA"> 
When a frequency of light passes through an atom, if the energy it has matches how much energy it would take to get electrons to their next orbit, then the electrons will absorb the light and move to a higher orbit. Eventually, the photon's energy is exhausted. The electron will return to its original orbit and release a photon of less than the initial excess energy. It absorbs some of the frequencies and reflects the other frequencies, which is what provides the color we see. The photon now has a color other than white light; if it absorbs everything but the blue wavelength, then it will appear blue. But absorbing and reflecting light are not the only options that can happen when light comes across atoms. Light could also pass right through a substance. This is what makes glass see-through because all the frequencies of light that humans can see pass right through the glass.    
	</p>
	<h2 class="b">What can light tell us about our surroundings? </h2>

<p class="stripeB"> 
	<img class="s" src="images/forest.jpeg.crdownload">
When we look at something, we gain information about it, such as its color, shape, and texture. Expanding on data from our senses, we can use our knowledge of the electromagnetic spectrum to determine how much heat the object has, whether it is energetic or not, and even what kind of elements it's made of. The light that an object creates or reflects gets absorbed by the electrons in an atom. So, the frequencies that those atoms absorb will appear black when separated by a prism and examined under a telescope. These bands of darkness can tell us what elements make up the object. Scientists discovered helium in the sun with this method. They took the sun's light and split it through a prism. Then they enlarged it by looking through a telescope, and they saw a band that they had never seen before. They named this new element after the sun. Later we found out that helium is an element on Earth.

Light allows us to see billions of light-years into the universe, and different wavelengths highlight different things. Infrared light, for example, can reveal nebulas with dark gas that don't give off enough visible light to be seen easily with telescopes. This section explains how different light sources provide us with insight into the stars and worlds far beyond our galaxy.
