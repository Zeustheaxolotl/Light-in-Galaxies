	If you looked at the galaxy above, Messier 51, through a telescope, then it would look entirely different. You would see only the light that humans can see. Instead, NASA combines multiple pictures--each in different kinds of light--of the same object to create spectacular images like this. Called a composite picture, this image reflects visible light, plus kinds of light that we can't see, specifically infrared, X-ray, and ultraviolet light.

One of the most exciting things about astronomy is looking at objects through your lens. So, this website has an interactive that lets you look at images of spiral galaxies and decide for yourself which kinds of light you want in the picture.
